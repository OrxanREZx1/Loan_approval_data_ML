# Loan Approval Classification

This project is a machine learning-based approach to predict whether a loan should be approved or not, based on a given set of applicant attributes. The project uses classification techniques to build a predictive model from a dataset containing information such as gender, income, education level, loan amount, credit history, and more.

## üìò Project Overview

- **Goal**: To predict loan approval status using historical data.
- **Data**: The dataset includes several features such as:
  - Gender
  - Marital Status
  - Education
  - Applicant Income
  - Loan Amount
  - Credit History
  - And other categorical and numerical features
- **Output**: A binary classification - `Loan_Status` (Approved or Not Approved).

## üìä Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning (handling missing values and encoding categorical features)
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution plots of key features
- Feature selection and engineering

## ü§ñ Model Building

The following models were explored:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## ‚úÖ Results

The best-performing model was selected based on its overall classification performance. The model can be used to assist banks or financial institutions in making faster and more consistent loan approval decisions.
